# INSTAGRAM_LOGIN_PAGE
I created an Instagram login page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a responsive design. CSS flexbox, media queries, and gradients styled the layout, while JavaScript added form validation and dynamic feedback. Features include styled input fields, hover effects, app download buttons, and a design replicating Instagramâ€™s clean interface.
